## INSPIRATION


The inspiration behind this project stems from the widespread issue of users mindlessly accepting website terms and conditions, leading to potential privacy and security risks. Recognizing the need for a solution that empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their data, our team was motivated to develop a user-friendly Chrome extension. The goal is to bridge the gap between complex legal language in agreements and user comprehension, promoting transparency and awareness. The commitment to digital literacy, user empowerment, and fostering a safer online environment drove our team to create a tool that not only highlights critical terms but also actively involves users in refining and improving the extension. The overarching inspiration lies in providing users with the means to navigate the digital landscape confidently, making conscious choices regarding their data privacy, and reshaping the narrative of online consent from passive acceptance to active participation.
